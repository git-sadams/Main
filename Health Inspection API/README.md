This service reads, sorts and edits a database of 1200 restaurants/food facilities in the city of Austin area. 
Each entry includes general information about a facility(name, address, zip code) as well as information about
health inspections conducted at the facliity(Type of inspection, Date of Inspection, and Inspection Score).
Each facility has a unique ID that enables a user to find it as needed. This service allows you to sort the data
in a number of ways, returning lists of restaurants/facilities by zip code, by score, or by ID. This service also
allows users to edit the database, changing the scores of the facilites to be better updated, or to add new
facilities altogether. This service also inlcudes an interesting function that allows you to find the average
health inspection score of an entire Zipcode, enabling the user to get a general idea of the health state of a small
region. This service was constructed by Samuel Adams as a part of University of Texas at Austin's COE332 Software
Engineering and Design Class.
